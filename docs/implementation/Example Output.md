Welcome to Cooper's Castle.

**Cooper's Castle - Entrance Foyer**

You are standing in a large entrance foyer. To the south, there are two double doors. There are corridors leading to the north, east, and west.

There is a **mysterious note** on the ground.
There is a **bronze sword** hanging on the wall.

There is an **ominous bird** standing on a perch.
