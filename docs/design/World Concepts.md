## World

*(Note: in the current iteration, each game only takes place within a single level. Thus, the world is an unused concept, but could be expanded upon in future iterations.)*

A **world** is a series of one or more **levels**. Each game takes place within a single world.

## Level

A **level** is a collection of connected **rooms**.

Each level generally has one or more overarching objectives, such as escaping a dungeon, obtaining a specific item, or defeating a powerful enemy.

Examples:

* Cooper's Castle
* The Mines of Moria
* Goblin Lair

## Rooms

A **room** represents an area that the adventurer can occupy. The adventurer is always located in exactly one room at a time. Rooms may contain **items** and/or **entities** that the player can interact with. Rooms usually have one or more ways to leave, either by moving in one of the cardinal directions or by interacting with something in the room (e.g. a ladder).

Examples:

* Entrance Foyer
* Primary Mine Shaft
* Storage Room

## Items

An **item** represents something in the world that can be picked up and used by the player.

Examples:

* mysterious note
* bronze short sword

## Entities

An **entity** represents something in the world that can be interacted with, but not picked up. Generally, entities are either other living beings, or static features in a room.

Examples:

* ominous bird
* goblin warrior
* lever
* bookcase
